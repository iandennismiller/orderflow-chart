Here's an outline of a Pydantic model that represents this structure, along with documentation to be added to the README file:

### Pydantic Model

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

class Dataset(BaseModel):
    dtypes: Dict[str, Any]
    index: Optional[list]  # Include if 'index' is a common column across all datasets
    # Define other common columns here, with types based on the dtypes hint

class ProcessedDataModel(BaseModel):
    orderflow: Dataset
    labels: Dataset
    green_hl: Dataset
    red_hl: Dataset
    green_oc: Dataset
    red_oc: Dataset
    orderflow2: Dataset
    ohlc: Dataset
    # Include any additional datasets here

```



Each dataset includes a `dtypes` dictionary detailing the expected type for each column, aiding in data processing and ensuring type safety. The data may also contain an `index` field used to set DataFrame indices, enhancing data manipulation and access capabilities.
